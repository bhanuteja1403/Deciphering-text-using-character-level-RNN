## Dataset
This project uses the [IMDB Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/), a popular benchmark for sentiment analysis tasks. The dataset consists of 50,000 movie reviews split evenly into 25,000 for training and 25,000 for testing, with an equal number of positive and negative reviews.
In this project, only the `review` text column is used (the `sentiment` column is dropped), and the text is further cleaned and processed for Caesar cipher-based sequence-to-sequence character-level translation.
